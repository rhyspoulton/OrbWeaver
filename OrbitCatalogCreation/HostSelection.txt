#Use this to select the range of redshifts of interest

#The lower limit of redshift
0 <= redshift

#The upper limit in the redshift (use inf if you want no upper limit)
redshift <= inf

#Please use the name of the datasets that are here: https://github.com/ICRAR/VELOCIraptor-STF/blob/master/doc/output.rst
#It is possible to use or operator here, but this needs to be on a single line. For example:
#
# (hostHaloID!=-1) | (Mass_200crit > 1e10)
#
#This selection is to select for host (hostHaloID!=-1) or has a mass greater than 1e10 Msun (Mass_200crit > 1e10), both sure they are both within brackets 

# The minimum number of snapshots that a objects has to exist to be considered as being a host (default 20)
MinSnapExist = 20


#Selecting hosts wih 50,000 particles
npart >= 50000
